# SpringBootAssessment Reflection

## What Did you like about this assessment?

This assessment allow me to understand the different functions of the individual codes.

I also made careless mistakes in my linking of the scripts and naming of functions. Hence, I spent alot of time debugging trying to find out the error.

I also like this assessment as it forces me to research and read the additional reading materials.

## What did you struggle?

I struggled in the inserting date into database for my form input.

I am still working on the solution, will have to submit first and work on it after office hour.

## What would make the experience better

I think it is good enough as we have the day to do this assessment with minimum distractions.

I feel that these assessments are good for me to build my portfolio and foundation knowledge.
